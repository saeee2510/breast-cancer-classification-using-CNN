The project "Breast Cancer Detection using CNN" on Kaggle focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting breast cancer from histopathology images. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation techniques, and model training to enhance classification accuracy. The model evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also visualizes results through confusion matrices and classification reports, aiming to aid in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer treatment.
